We demonstrate how to input a certain graph.
We have some formulas to caculate chromatic symmetric functions of several specific graphs other than Stanley's method of m basis expansion.
We also show functions of check 'b'-positivity of a graph,where 'b' is any basis of a space, including symmetric functions.
